# TnodaRecreate
I used the Tnoda animation and stripped everything I did not need and then inputted some Delta's flight data in.
I hosted the site on Google Cloud, but before that, I hosted it on a local server

How to host on local server:
1) Download files and make sure the file tree is the same.
2) Open cmd and redirect to the the folder with "index.html" is in
3) Type the prompt "python -m http.server"
4) On an internet browser go to the following address: "localhost:8000"
